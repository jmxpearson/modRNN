# RNNs with modulators
Code to train a recurrent neural network to solve the task of [Pinto _et al._ (2018)](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/behavioral-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2018.00036/full). 

Models trained using PyTorch.

To install dependencies install `uv` and run
```
uv sync
```
from within the directory.

The model can then be run using
```
uv run model.py
```
